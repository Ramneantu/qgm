Quantum Generative Model (QGM)

An implementation of factor graphs and the tensor network version of the quantum generative model described in "A quantum machine learning algorithm based on generative models" in 2018 by Gao et al.

Provides functionality to create a factor graph and transform it to an equivalent QGM by the procedure given in Fig.2 of the aforementioned paper.
